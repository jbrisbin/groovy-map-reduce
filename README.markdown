== RabbitMQ-based Groovy Map/Reduce Framework

This is just the first alpha (consider it 0.0.1.ALPHA) of a Groovy Map/Reduce framework that uses RabbitMQ to comminucate.

You'll need Maven 2.x to build it.

Unit test src/test/java shows how to send a message and get the reduced response(s).

It's really rough at the moment. The test works but just for me. Would love to know what you think! :)
